# Abrid
## What is Abrid?
Abrid is a simple, abridged (no pun intended) operating system with the basic essentials, and a bit more.
Right off the bat, abrid includes TCC (tiny c compiler), CPI (a small C++ compiler) and Bash 4.4.
## How do I install Abrid?
### + in ISO form?
Currently, abrid does not have a dedicated ISO file, but we are hoping to add one soon.
### Well, if I can't install without making my own ISO file, how do I test it?
The way to test it out although is to run `make test` in the `/bin` folder.
